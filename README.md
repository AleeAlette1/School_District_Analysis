# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
After the school board leans that the original student_completee.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty with the readinng and math scores of Thomas High School's 9th grade class the school board has asked Maria for help. Maria asks you to replace the math and reading scores in question with NaNs - all other scores should stay the same.
