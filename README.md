# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
After the school board leans that the original student_completee.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty with the readinng and math scores of Thomas High School's 9th grade class the school board has asked Maria for help. Maria asks you to replace the math and reading scores in question with NaNs - all other scores should stay the same. Once the 9th grade Thomas High School's math and reading scores are replace, Maria would like you to repeat an earlier analysis and then write an analysis with the changes.

## Summary
In summary, five changes occured to not only the school and the district, but also to the school type results: 
1. Average math scores decreased
2. Average reading scores decreased. 
3. The percentage of students passing math decreased. 
4. The percentage of students passing reading decreased
5. The overall percentage of students passing decreased. 

Overall we can see that Thomas High School saw the biggest drops in averages because the scores affect their direct results, but even so, removing one grades worth of scores is enough to shift the districts overall averages as well.
